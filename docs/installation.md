```

**Ubuntu/Debian**

Install packges with _apt_ (or _apt-get_ if you prefer).

```


## Install project dependencies

It is usually best-practice in Python projects to install into a sandboxed _virtual environment_, which is set to a specific Python version and contains on the packages you install into it so that your Python projects do not get affected.

Follow this guide to [Setup a Python 3 Virtual Environment](https://gist.github.com/MichaelCurrin/3a4d14ba1763b4d6a1884f56a01412b7). 

You can then continue to the [Usage](/docs/usage.md) doc.
